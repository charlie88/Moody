This app allows you to tell all your friends about how you are feeling!
Simply move the slider in the app to represent your mood; red for sad and blue for happy! The face on the phone says it all... just leave the app running at work while charging, or at home when you're working.
You can also add a description of your mood and twitter it at the press of a button!

I found a few screenshots and the like here... check them out...
